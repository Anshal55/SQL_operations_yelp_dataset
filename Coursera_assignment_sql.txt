Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet


This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.


In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.


For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.






Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding


1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
        
i. Attribute table =10,000
ii. Business table =10,000
iii. Category table =10,000
iv. Checkin table =10,000
v. elite_years table =10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table =10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table =10,000
        




2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.


i. Business =10,000
ii. Hours =1562
iii. Category =2643
iv. Attribute =1115
v. Review =8090(business_id)
vi. Checkin =493 
vii. Photo =6493
viii. Tip = 3979(business_id)
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years =2780


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.        






3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."


        Answer: NO

(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)


Not really as fans are not consistently distributed opposite to number of reviews.


        


        
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?


        Answer:
    The Number of reviews with word love(1780)  are much more than hate(232).


        
        SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT count(text)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%love%";


SELECT count(text)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%hate%";






        
        
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:


        SQL code used to arrive at answer:

LIMIT 10;


        
        
        Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
City=Phoenix , Category=Restaurants


1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
        
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
ANS: Not really the hours don’t actually determine the rating here.




ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
ANS: Avg. review count for 1-4: 125.6
         Avg review count for 4-5:   219
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
ANS : No, All of them seem to have different postal code and different rating and working hours.


SQL code used for analysis: 


SELECT b.name,
b.city,
c.category,
b.stars,
h.hours,
b.postal_code,
b.review_count
FROM (business b INNER JOIN
category c ON b.id=c.business_id)
INNER JOIN hours h ON h.business_id=c.business_id
WHERE b.city='Phoenix'
AND c.category='Restaurants'
GROUP BY b.stars;
                
                
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
                
i. Difference 1:
Open businesses have higher working hours.
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
The no of reviews are higher for open businesses.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT b.is_open,
b.name,
b.city,
c.category,
b.stars,
h.hours,
b.postal_code,
b.review_count
FROM (business b INNER JOIN
category c ON b.id=c.business_id)
INNER JOIN hours h ON h.business_id=c.business_id
GROUP BY b.is_open;




        
        
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.


Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
        
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I want to predict whether the business is likely to be open or closed.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
To do so I need various attributes of the data like name, location, stars, state, latitude, longitude , review_count etc.
By getting the above data I can implement any classification model on the data to predict the required output(i.e open or not).
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
